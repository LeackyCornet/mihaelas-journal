# 4th of Teragoth 861st Year Age of Air, Taramont

Pemu gnome, I wish he had stayed out of all of this, for all our sakes. Overhearing us talking to Ailuin in tower, yaga, what was he doing listening to us? Now we have to trust him to hold his tongue? I would be more comfortable if he was with someone I trusted, as apparently keeping him somewhere he cannot blather is wrong simply because only example I could think of was dungeon. Pish. It is shame Tata and Nana have gone, I would have felt better if this fool had been left in their care. Not to mention it would have been nice to see them once more, I have missed them over years.

At least we no longer have to worry about prisoner we took in mountains. And I look forward to getting my new armour when we next return to this damn town. Even if it was expensive. It feels strange to spend so lavishly after all these long years, 200g. I would never have thought of spending that much year ago on glorified clothing.
