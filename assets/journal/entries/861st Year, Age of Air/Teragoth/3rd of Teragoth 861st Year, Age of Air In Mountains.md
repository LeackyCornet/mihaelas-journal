# 3rd of Teragoth 861st Year Age of Air, Mountains

Babcha woke us up last night while it was still dark. Soon it became apparent why as pack of wolves appeared at top of ridge behind our camp. Babcha tried to reason with what I assume was leader but he ignored us and told pack to attack us. Fortunately, for some reason lot of them just came up and kind of wandered around. It was some fight, there was this massive white wolf that spewed horrible cold force at us. I kind of lost track of what happened, it was somewhat chaotic, but I loosed bolt at leader before I got attacked by another wolf. I spent rest of fight engaged with it and eventually felled it, poor thing. I wish it did not have to be. When fight was over all the wolves ran away bar two, great big white one and what turned out to be Uthal.

...

After waking we continued east in search of this rendezvous. After while we found tower that note described as next waypoint and turned north. I wonder if we will regret not looking into the source of that smoke. Soon Babcha noticed some footprints, obviously from some small humanoid. As it might have been our halfling friend from Rusty Dragon I told others what Xaon had told us when we went to king. I do not think Babcha was best pleased. As such we continued north post haste. And did not we then get sight. On path was this giant bird thing with injured wing. Uthal and Babcha started approaching it carefully and threw some food down for it. Soon it left, I hope it is ok, and we headed north.

As it was starting to get dark we saw light from fire on top of ridge. We approached as quietly as we could, which was not easy as I could barely see anything. I heard some people calling out to each other and it seems like those footprints might have been gnome, who promptly got himself tied up.

Eventually inevitable happened and combat began. Uthal turned himself into giant spider, which brought back unwelcome memories, but at least he tried to tell me and when he picked me up and carried me on his back it made for easy way up hill. Nettle ran off by herself and I had no idea where Babcha was at this point. Turns out there was someone from empire who had this metal beast under his control. I loosed bolt at man but then beast attacked me. But with my help, Babcha and her wolf, which had been following us for some strange reason, managed to weaken beast, as did Uthal who landed killing blow with javelin. Then, with everyone around him, man surrendered.

Babcha then hurried off and when I caught up with her she was with another man, who I soon recognised as grokkel who tried to kill me and stole my things first night at Final Toll. And Babcha made him give it all back. We then returned with this other prisoner, who was acting very strangely, to Uthal and Nettle and searched camp.

Then we were accosted by halfling from Rusty Dragon, who was most upset that we had ruined his grand plans to infiltrate Black Roses. Yaga, what care I? we all then started trying to agree on who should get what. Seems little unfair to me that he should prosper from fruits of our labour.

...

So, our little prisoner gave us bit of information while I made sure gnome was ok. We then had look at puzzle box man had been carrying. Me and Uthsl eventually got it open and when we did Babcha wanted to be one who read documents inside, as if she had done something. We also let halfling look at them, though I still do not know why he gets to benefit. We are ones who shed blood to get them. Still, at least when he took his leave he killed grokkel so I do not have to worry about him coming for his things this time. Although I thought he wanted to question him. Pemu. Also makes me wonder why he asked me to move him if was always going to just kill him. I wonder if he was just trying to impress us, he was trying to talk big then.

But, Yaga, I am so cold. I wish Ailuin had not done whatever magic she did when she arrived. I did not like it how snow just started swirling round me, all this is so strange. But when this spell, or whatever, stopped all that snow, which had melted, fell on me. Pish. And now I am so cold, all I can say is thank Yaga for this fire.

All that being said, it was good to see Ailuin. I know she means a lot to Babcha and I think she was worried when we could not find her in Taramont last. It was less good to see the state of her, she looks like she got beat up.

And that bird thing she road in on, looks the same as whatever we met on way here just passed tower. I hope it is ok.

Yaga, I am still cold, but this fire is starting to help.
