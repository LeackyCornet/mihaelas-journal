# 4th of Teragoth 861st Year Age of Air, Mountains

Yaga, would people stop turning into animals. Got attacked by mob of orc bandits last night. What won the fight? Was it Uthal turning into bear? No. Was it Uthal turning into wolf? No, although he did. It was when this great big dragon came down and scared away orcs. Who was this dragon? Azshara. Everyone is turning into animals and I do not like it. I want it to stop.

Although, I should be grateful. I could not see any of them lurking in dark when they first called out, and then Babcha made me stop glowing and stopped fire, so I could not see anything, at least until Nettle lit torch. I made my way up cliff face at back of camp opposite of where sounds came from. Fortunately no one was there. I then readied my crossbow and waited. I did not have to wait long as soon hordes of orcs swamped into camp. I loosed bolt at first one as it headed to Babcha, and what shot, I found my mark and felled brute. Unfortunately, I could not stop any others as they surrounded my friends. I saw Babcha fall, and even though Ailuin joined fight it looked lost. I saw Nettle run, I do not think I have ever seen her flee fight. Uthal did not, which does not surprise me. I do not think he knows how to leave fight.

But then, as I and Nettle where fleeing and sounds of battle betrayed what was happening behind us, giant dragon appeared and next thing I knew was orc giving order to flee. I made my way back to camp and saw Ailuin talking to dragon as if she knew it. Then dragon turned into Azshara.

Yaga, what is going on?
