# 6th of Teragoth 861st Year Age of Air, Mountains

On approach to Walden Heights we came across these giants. Or something, to be honest I am not sure what they were but they made hideous noise. We tried to sneak past them, but after climbing cliff face as she tried to flank them Babcha fell and seemed to attract their attention. Fortunately she was quick enough to disappear somewhere before they saw her and I managed to get Uthal to throw stone in opposite direction to try and distract them. I think it worked. Then I saw Babcha at top of cliff, she was waving at us like reed in wind trying to get us to follow her. I quickly made my way to base and climbed rope she had lowered and Nettle followed. Uthal, pemee, then went up to things and seemed to start talking to them. I have little idea what happened but they seemed provoked to anger. At that point I feared worst, but rather than attacking Uthal as I had feared they started fighting amongst themselves. Babcha then loosed her bow and I followed with my crossbow. Soon three things were on floor and we could safely continue. No thanks to Nettle.
