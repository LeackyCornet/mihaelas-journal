How have I not written in this for ten days? I'm still missing Mały, but I've stopped crying. Praise Llirra, she has given me strength. Now shine is finished it is good thing, I've spent so much time in there, building it during day and praying in evening. I feel Ailuin has noticed, she'sbeen very supportive since Mały left.

Now I know why I haven't written for ten days. Each day is same and there's nothing to write. I get up, eat, work, eat, work, eat, pray and then, at end of day, we commune. That's only part of day that changes. Sometimes I don't feel like talking so I play brood or pray. Sometimes I'll play cards or dice with people, mainly Durzol and Krusk, although Ailuin has been joining in more since Mały left and seems to do so more when I'm feeling down. I like Ailuin. Of course, if Eary happens to show up when we play she'll join, and Urdlen plays as well, he seems quite good at tongo. Other times we'll talk, either as small groups or I'll talk to just one person. I prefer talking one to one.

But it's all been much same. Only thinf is, thinking about it, Nettle hasn't played since that one night. And she hasn't drank as much as she did then. What was significant about that day?
