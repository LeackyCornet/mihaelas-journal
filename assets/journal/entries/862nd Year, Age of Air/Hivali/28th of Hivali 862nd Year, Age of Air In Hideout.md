Yaga, I hurt. I was right, Nettle had been going easy. Seems training proper has begun.

Urdlen has spoken so much about his wife since he told me. Verzana sounds lovely and I'm sure it would be pleasure to meet her. He seems very. Ow, that hurt. Seems very devoted to her, he gets so emotional when he talks about her. Pish! My arm is killing me. Why Nettle? Why? What did I do to anger you and your Gods?

Intereresting that he taught in Yita, that's where King is. I wonder how we can use his knowledge when we go check on King, may Llirra protect him. And I wonder if we could persuade any of his students to join cause. Yita, I haven't been to Emerald Depths in years. That will take me back. Shame it won't be on equinox.
