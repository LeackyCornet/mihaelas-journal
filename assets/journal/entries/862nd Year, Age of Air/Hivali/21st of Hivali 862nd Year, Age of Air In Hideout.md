I can't believe it, Urdlen is married to halfling. I can't believe he didn't tell me about Verzana before, she's striking. He showed me illusion of her.

I'm amazed that he's never met her family though. We're typically very tightly knit with our families and it seems weird that she views him as her family. well, viewing him as part of her family, or as her family in sense Ma, Pa and Ma≈Çy are my family. But as her entire family? Not wanting to introduce him to them or go see them for festivals? That seems odd to me. I mean, even uncle Corrin is family. I hope there's nothing wrong there. If somehow Urdlen is only family Verzna has she must be lonely right now. Yaga, I'd know, all those years by myself. I'll pray for her. At least Babcha is here for me, she may not even have that.
