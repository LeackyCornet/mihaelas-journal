# 19th of Obeli 862nd Year Age of Air, Thandrium

This morning we agreed on what we'd do. I still think I should go to Eilnala and try to make allies of shadow thieves, but Babcha was very against it. I think she has trust issues, but, if I'm honesty, I may not be one to talk. We agreed what misinformation we'd tell Mateki and Remi, but we only managed to talk to Mateki before council.

Before we even went there however we went to see Gertrude and Kurbor. Gertrude's shop seemed very run down, it seems Sardar is doing lot to run him down, grokkel. We still managed to buy some things though and that deer thing, Eary, showed up. At Kurbor's we got Babcha's sword and Nettle's shield, but I was dismayed at how he was acting, he seemed delighted at about current situation because it was good for business, pem. Gertrude seemed wiser, he joined our cause, even if he did leave it to chance.

But, Yaga, event of day was at council meeting. That grokkel empire women was there, she is such showman, so arrogant. I can't stand people like her. She delivered her terms and left us to decide what to do, but only when she seemed to find our behaviour to antagonistic and plodded out. Frumpy grokkel. I did find it funny how annoyed she got because Babcha wouldn't sit down and I sat on table, shame Nettle didn't make stand. But when she jumped on table and went to kick me I got such shock, I was suddenly in different realm and there was bunny thing I thought I saw yesterday. I think Eary called it fidget. It slapped my hand and seemed happy at what had happened, so I guess it is with Eary and maybe Eary is all right. When I got over my shock though I found it so funny and could not stop grinning. Maybe this magic can be fun.

After she left we spoke about what to do. Sardar, no surprise, just wanted to surrender. I do not trust him and can't help but think we'd all be better off if he was dead. Perhaps. Remi wanted to fight, and Mateki wanted to stall. Babcha wanted to kill leader and replace her with someone. After we all voted Isophie decided to adopt combination of Babcha's and Mateki's plans, which is what I thought was best.

Guess we're off hunting now. I only hope these politicians do their job properly and Sardar doesn't compromise things. Still, perhaps.

I'm also surprised Nettle voted to just stall. I would have thought she'd be more confrontational, after all, she was soldier.

I also wonder if she'll train me to use shield. I can't help but think buckler would be useful now I don't have my crossbow. And I wonder what Urdlen and Eary will be like, it feels like they're going to be around awhile.

I wish I could talk to Ma and Pa, they'd know what to do. And I wish Vujelk was here.
