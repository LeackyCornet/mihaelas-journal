# 15th of Obeli 862nd Year Age of Air, Thandrium

Yaga, it was so good to see Babcha and Vujek after all these months. They've changed. Babcha is now a werewolf and Vujek has lost his arm. But what care i? it's just to good to see them.

But curse that pem dragon. I would have enjoyed our reunion more had it not been for beast. Alas there was no time for hellos at first, me and Mały had to worry about stopping it from killing Vujek first. Yaga, he looked in a bad way. Praise Lliira for Ailuin, for she used magic and Vujek got off floor. It was some fight that took place. I hit beast with stone from my sling and used my magic on it, Yaga I'm still getting used to this, Mały struck it with his wip while Babcha, Durzol and Vujek attacvked it in melee.

Eventually beast was felled, good ridence, and we had chance to make greetings. But it was soon back to task in hand, not that I had much idea what it was at time. We went to find Thorbir, praise Lliira, and learnt his father had died and concluded that Dawn Star had been taken. This was not happy reunion,I feel sorry for Thorbir. I know what it is too loose family.

But alas, again we had little time and went in search of Dawn Star. I felt little lost. I know not what has happened to my friends or about this place. Something to do with Empire is afoot and I fear trouble is in reeds.

I fear we must now take time to talk and plan. I want to know what that thing was in air that left wherever we are. And what happened to Vujek.

...

I wonder who that man was. He seemed to know others and gave them all something, he even gave me something, even if it was just silly stone. Why do I want stone? Once he'd said his farewells he departed with empire men. Guess I won't get to know him. But, Yaga, Azshara was rude. As soon as he' he'd gone she was talking about how everything he'd said had been boring, I thought it was rather touching, I mean it seemed to touch Nettle and she's cold. And boring indeed, all Azshara wanted to talk about was that boring political stuff. But I guess it was necessary, we do need to decide what to do. I just wish it didn't take so long.

Whatever, we found way to get to Taramount, or at least part of way with help of dwarves. I hope Thorbir is ok and manages after we leave.
