# 15th of Domak 862 Age of Air, Standing Stones

This place is strange, there's something slightly unsettling about it. I'm glad Urdlen has made this tent. I hope it is worth it coming here.

It's strange this place indeed. It feels eerie but somehow also spiritual. It's making me think of Ma≈Çy and Vujek. I hope they're ok. I'd rather be with them than here. But I want to help Morthos find his piece.
