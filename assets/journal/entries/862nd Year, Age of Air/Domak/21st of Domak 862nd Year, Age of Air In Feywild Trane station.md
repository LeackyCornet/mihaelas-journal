# 21st of Domak 862nd Year Age of Air, Feywild Trane station

We're waiting at something Babcha is calling Tane station, whatever that is. Well I know not what train is, I know I was right to be apprehensive about coming to feywild. This place is so bizarre, and I don't like it.

And already things have gone wrong, Babcha was going to lead us back through portal to wherever she wanted to go, saying it was quickest way. But portal seemed to brake and then Kitsune appeared with some guards and we were led to cell. Horrible cell, it was open at back and sloped towards opening with water running out. It's almost like they want us to die. But soon we were taken to see river king, I can understand why they call him that, everything was full of water in that place.

But Babcha seemed to be able to convince him that rummers about her weren't true, but I have horrible feeling about these prophesies. One I've heard said she's one of Seven and we''l defeat Nocturne, apparently there's Fey prophecy that says she'll inadvertently destroy Feywild. I can't help but wonder if somehow it's by defeating Nocturne that she destroys Feywild. Who knows? I certainly don't.

As I said, Babcha managed to convince River king she wasn't threat and he let us go, in spite of Eary's efforts to get us killed. Trying to cast magic on that tree, I'm glad I stopped her there, and following river king around moking him. Stupid thing. But we were allowed to go, but river king told us he wanted Kitsune to go with us as our guide, and to make sure we don't do wrong. Clearly he doesn't trust us completely.

And now we're at this station waiting for it to rain, because that's when train runs or something. What is train? Some kind of boat? How dose it raining mean it can go? I don't understand this place, and won't be sad when I leave.
