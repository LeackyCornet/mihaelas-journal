# 17th of Domak 862nd Year Age of Air, drilwood, Elderyard Road

Babcha and Eary caught up with us before we'd gotten far, so I don'r know what all worry was about this morning. But after they had strange things happened, not least of which was that Nettle complimented me when we trained. Are rivers flowing uphill?

I don't know what Babcha found this morning, but I think putting it in bag of holding was mistake. All of sudden things just started flying out of bag and eventually all that was left was normal bag, it was no longer magic and we could no longer fit all our gear in it. It was queer, I don't like what was happening, or that cube. it felt like it was sapping my magic. Everyone felt it. Well, everyone except Nettle. Morthos hid it in bush away from Urdlen's shelter and we divided all goods from bag between us to take back to hideout. I ended up carrying two suits of armour. I don't look forward to carrying them back to stones, they're heavy.

And such shame this happened. We had done well, I thought. I had managed to do more training with my shield and I think I was getting better, I remembered that technique that Nettle had taught me where you hold out your shield to blind your opponent. I must have done well, or at least better than before, for Nettle complimented me on my work. All that even with Urdlen trying to interear. Maybe I'll get hang of this properly soon.
