# 7th of Teragoth 861st Year Age of Air, Walden Heights

I hate orcs, savages. We arrived at Walden Heights to sight of normal town, or so it looked. Red Dragon I saw on wing soon changed my perspective and it was not long before we could make out green skins in town. We hastened to town only to find mob of barbaric creatures attacking woman and man and their children. We all rushed in to try and save them but in spite of our best efforts we could not save mother. Thank yaga Nettle actually did something this time. And I think it good thing all those scum lay dead when we were done.

We then fled to keep with yet more orcs chasing us. I am glad we are all safe now, but yaga, Babcha cut it close. To close for my comfort.
