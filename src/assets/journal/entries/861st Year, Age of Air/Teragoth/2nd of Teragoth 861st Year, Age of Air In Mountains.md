# 2nd of Teragoth 861st Year Age of Air, Mountains

It took us fair to long to decide what to do this morning. I read note out for them and I said we had about 36 hours before this meeting so clearly time was of essence, but they went round and round in conversation about what to do. Finally we decided that we should ask king for use if his airship and Uthal wanted to talk to high druid. So we split up, Uthal and Babcha went to druid while I went to king with Nettle. I did not look forward to that meeting.

When we met him he refused to let us use airship, saying he had not given us right to use it, but would grant right if we proved ourselves. Pem grockel, it is not like we were wanting to go gang jolly. We wanted it to do task he had set us. Fortunately someone there decided it worthwhile to offer us aid and said we could use teleportation chamber in Circle of Mages tower.

We also got some interesting news from Seeker Xaon. Apparently halfling from Rusty Dragon may have been member of some group and was working with Xaon. Nettle said she had not met him, so assuming she was not lying, other two might be having to explain themselves.

Anyway, we set off to tower and Babcha strange talking bird came down to squawk at me about how others had found way to Briar Pass. We stayed with our original means as Babcha said she would meet us there.

After some time waiting around in tower for what Babcha called "bureaucracy" we were finally allowed to go. We put our hands on this thing in the middle of room and next thing I knew we were somewhere else. I do not like this strange stuff. Never thought I would say this, but u prefer boat.

When we went to leave this new keep place couple of upstarts decided to quiz us, one just wanted to know who we were and what we were doing, other was rather threatening and aggressive. If Nettle does not talk to others about him I think I should. Whatever, we were allowed to leave and set off down path looking for stone described in note. We found Babcha and Uthal waiting couple of miles down road and continued with them.

When we found stone we turned east off path as directions on note said. After while we came to what seemed like dead end, but more significant than that was all the pools of green around and strange statues or, at least, they looked like statues. More significant that that was strange metal beast that came out of cave. Yaga, I wanted to stay away from it. But, thankfully, we felled it fairly quickly. Uthal, pemu, decided to get all up close and personal before transforming into bear. Nettle also got bit close, but soon backed away. While Uthal wrestled with beast, and Babcha did I do not know what, I kept my distance and loosed at it with my crossbow. Not that it seemed to do much at first, but my third bolt seemed to reveal weakness in its armour. Or hide. Or whatever. Then Babcha came into fight in spectacular fashion, sending one blast at beast which seemed to finish it off even though it had enough left in it to at least start running at Nettle before exploding.

If you are only going to make one contribution to fight, I guess it is good to make it count. After beast fell I retrieved the one bolt that survived before taking careful look at that note, I wanted to make sure we were going right way. Which it seemed we were.

As such we continued until we decided it was time to make camp and found sheltered little alcove and made fire. After having some of Uthal berries and tea he made from them Babcha decided she would take first watch and left us. Uthal went to talk to Nettle, it was interesting listening to her talk about her background. And that floating sword of her's is strange.
