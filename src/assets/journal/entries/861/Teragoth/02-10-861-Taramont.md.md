# 2nd of Teragoth 861st Year Age of Air, Taramont

I was woken by loud crash this morning. But when I got to Uthal room, where it had come from, all I found was fool under his bed. Yep, definitely did not go to plan. Oh, listening to Babcha now. No, things did not go to plan. Uthal was meant to get some herbs and ended up in fight with eight people somehow. Sounds like last night would have been fun to watch.

Now to sort out Butterbur issue.

Well that did not go as expected. I was hoping this halfling would be in bar so I could go up and talk to him. But I needed drink if I was to sit in bar and wait, I could not say anything because Butterbur would recognise my voice. Yaga, I did not realise how rude he was when I first met him. Grockel. Anyway, he asked his guard to escort me out, but not before I had tried to signal to Uthal to get others. Whatever, by time I was halfway to exit I had had enough of playing and took off my hat. Now pem guard started dragging me to back to be put with "the others", whatever that means. I think someone should find out. Then Babcha appeared and, I am guessing, started playing with fire as it changed colour. Not that it did much or stopped me getting dragged down side corridor.

But there things changed as suddenly Butterbur fell asleep. Tired of this pem dragging me around I tried to stab him but he deflected my blow then he swung at me with his sword. But before either of us could do anything else he let go, I guess it must have been Babcha doing as she then told me to run before doing so herself. I also took my leave, but not without keeping my promise to Butterbur on way. Once I got my knife free I made for exit, but when I rounded corner into corridor it seems guard came free of whatever Babcha had done to him as he started chasing me. In bar I saw red haired halfling lying on floor, I guess that must have been Uthal work as he got note, or maybe Nettle. not sure where she was in all this. Doing something useful I hope. But all is well as we all got out. Apparently I am no longer welcome there.

When Uthal showed me note it was little hard to read but it mentioned meeting up in Maytarn Mountains. And I think we have 36 hours to get there. I am not sure how we are going to do all this. We have still got Thorbir to save.
