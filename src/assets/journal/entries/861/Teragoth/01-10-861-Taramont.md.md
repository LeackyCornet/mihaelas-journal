# 1st of Teragoth 861st Year Age of Air, Taramont

Yesterday was really hard day. Getting accosted by some pemu loudmouth who was convinced his party was better than us. I do not know why others entertained his pem idea of contest. I saw his like in troupe, both members and customers, always boasting about how good they are, always with something to prove. Pathetic. Best way to deal with their like is to ignore them, make them stew in their ridiculous need for recognition.

However, Uthal did himself proud, beating their orc in pem contest of strength, it did not surprise me when they went to pub together afterwards. It was painfully obvious that thy had more in common with each other than just being their group muscle.

I was little surprised when Babcha entertained fool need for recognition by engaging in some silly magic show. I do not know why I stayed as long as I did. At least Uthal was not too hard to find. Same cannot be said for teaching his new drinking friend how to play dice however. I have had more luck getting stones to float.

At least it was good fun and, unlike his self proclaimed leader, he proved nice enough person. I would have liked to have seen just how drunk he would have got if we carried on playing. Oh well, Uthal proved to be good company and willing to play. He was even willing to play for coin. But, before we could start to roll, that little shit came back in something of mood. From what I can gather fool was arrogant enough to challenge Babcha to dule. And now everyone has seen him for child he is. I hope that sufficiently tarnishes his reputation.

But, alas, we had little time to revel in his humiliation as it became apparent that there was something going on at fair. And, it turned out, that something was Uthal new friend who, in his drunkenness, had grabbed onto wheel and fallen off. Fortunately he lived, I would have felt rather bad if he had not as I was one who was, somewhat, responsible for his intoxicated state.

What was less fortunate, or at least that is how it felt at time, was where we then found ourselves. Across way where collection of tents, outside which was ma and pa. They were about to perform song, listening to them reminded me of when I was child. When they had finished – this hurts to write, I am feeling emotional now just writing this – I went up to them. Over last month or so I have been trapped in dungeon; escaped from wizard; had one of my company try and kill me; fought bandits, dragons, vampires; been kidnapped, interrogated and tortured by witch who then tried to kill me; fought spiders, nearly saw Babcha die; been looked down on, mocked and derided; been put on trial. None of it, none, was as hard as what I did then. To face my parents, after 15 years, after failing them so gravely, was bravest thing I have ever done. But, by Lliira, I am glad I had courage. I am glad Babcha told me I should. Seeing them was best thing that has happened to me in years, since that day. Unsurprisingly ma did ask where Mały was. I could not lie to her, however much truth hurt I would not lie. So now they know. They did not take it well, but I do not blame them. Milil knows I did not. I cannot blame ma for asking for some time, I would have if position was other way. So I took my leave and was going to go back to Final Toll. I wish Babcha had offered to come back with me, and I wish Uthal loudmouth friend had stayed away, but they all decided to go to circus as planned. I would have, but I just did not have heart after what had just happened, I think others understood. But fate smiled on me, if only briefly, as Bruno saw me and said hello. It was good to see child and he lifted my soul. His parents called him away as they were planning on going to circus. But, before I could make my way back for what then would have been much more pleasurable evening than I was expecting moment ago, I saw Viconius making for circus. Not knowing what he might try to do to my fellows I followed hopping to warn them. Babcha response made me wonder why I had bothered, but with hindsight I think it was good I returned.

Because, when Viconius interned ring to begin his performance, I got shock of my life. Out of nowhere, looking like hell, Perrin appeared from nowhere. But this was not my Mały, my Mały would not have attacked Nana. After trapping Viconius in lamp – good riddance I say – Mały vanished into this strange orb. Babcha then also disappeared into it and I followed her. I then found myself in this silent world of shadows with this strange light like rope leading off into distance. With nothing else to do I followed it. Eventually it led to this glowing ball and everyone else appeared. I could not hear anything although I could see others talking. We then all went through thing and appeared at Marblerock pish. On far bank was Mały. He told us he wanted revenge on Viconius and what had happened to him, I cannot really remember it. My head would have been spinning at best of times, but that place, realm or whatever/wherever we were was weird. Whatever happened we left Mały and found ourselves back in circus.

After I have no idea how long Uthal picked me up and I think everyone started back towards Final Toll. I must have fallen asleep at some point and I guess they must have taken me back there as I was woken in early hours by Babcha bursting into my quarters saying there was fire in town. I went to wake Nettle as Uthal struggled to get his armour on.

When I got to fire Babcha was already there and helping to put fire out and I started to help as well. When Uthal arrived he charged into shop, with Nettle following, and they came out shortly with young female. They claimed that they had found bodies in cellar chained up. Owner of store was named as Rufus Telpin and he was soon found trying to leave city. He should have saved his breath grockel, his pathetic pleas were not enough to get Babcha mercy. Rightly so.

With fire dealt with and its victim being cared for we left that filth with guards and returned to Final Toll for what remained of night.

When I woke I went to bar to steel myself for my trip to see my parents. For some reason Nettle stayed with me, she confuses me. As I was about to leave Tata entered. We then went to my quarters where we had wonderful talk. It was lovely to be with him again. And Nana is ok.

Now, I look forward to sharing meal with my ma and pa. Same cannot be said for this council meeting.

At least I have that meal to look forward to, I am sure it will get me through.

...

They say I am money grabbing coin whore. 2g for 20 arrows at pemu shop, and Nettle charged me twice that! Coin whore indeed, but at least it means I will not suffer that pemee again. At least, hopefully.

I am glad halfling girl is ok, or as ok as you can be after being dragged out burning building. I hope she gets better, those at Temple of Helm had better look after her.

Milil, I was not looking forward to that council meeting, but it turned out ok in end. After long discussion it seems that progress will actually be made with refugees outside. Council agreed to provide them with food and water, while things could be put in place to disperse them across cities and give them citizenship. I understand their concerns that there are imperial spies among refugees, but it should not be too hard to find them jobs where they cannot find any useful information and, once they have identified spies, they can even feed them false information.

Fools did not see it prudent to look into vampire issue though, pemay, pem groackelay. At least it meant we got to see who is sensible and who is callus grockel.

On plus side, when we spoke of Viconius Babcha revealed his true nature and he was subsequently stripped of his position on council. That is how you do it Mały, revenge hurts more if you are alive.

There seemed to be great deal of fear around empire and there was word that orcs are going on raids. But I am not sure how reliable Quentis source is, considering after giving their information they slipped into coma. And that says nothing of how much I trust Quentis. Regardless, we have been tasked with going to Waldon Heights to investigate these raids.

Interestingly, that dirtbag Butterbur came up at council. Xaon had been keeping eye on Rusty Dragon when he noticed halfling get note from Butterbur using password "Black Rose". Now we are also tasked with going to Rusty Dragon and finding this halfling and finding out what they know. I look forward to that task.

By Yaga were these people petty and pathetic though. Each out for their own interest and unable to see common good. That pemu goliath admiral, refusing to help refugees, because some might be spies. And then, when I give her an opportunity to identify spies she mocks me. I see no reason to help her. But, pish, worst was Sardar Karmi. That greedy grockelu, he has no interest in anything but making himself richer. I doubt he will get any help from us. I suspect that writ will not find its way to Waldon Heights. Even if Remi had not asked us to go there and see what dirt we could find linking Karmi to major, I am not sure we would have helped. While I have no interest in involving myself in Remi power struggle, hurting Karmi dose sound like worthwhile endeavour.

I am saddened to hear of Thorbir troubles. I hope we can reach him in time to save him from whatever trouble he has gotten himself in. We lost Lyra and Fang, I do not want to lose anyone else. But first, there is small matter of that halfling at Rusty Dragon to deal with, and my promise to Butterbur.

...

After council we discussed our intentions for following morning and I then took my leave. On way to find my parents I passed ferris wheel and you could still see where Uthal orc friend had landed. I reckon that will make story or tow, maybe even song.

When I got to site where all performers tents where I asked someone if he knew where Thorngages where and if he could show me. He did, fortunately, and when I arrived at my ma and pa tent Nana was sat up. Soon we had agreed to go out for dinner and I led them to Delosar. I am so happy that Nana is recovered.

At Delosar he claimed that there had been complaints regarding his food, I wonder why. Pem ooze. All is well and for better though I guess, as he bought this strange thing that made dinner for us. It seemed reasonably priced too, 5G/5 for three meals and three drinks. If we come back to Taramont I might recommend this place.

While conversation was little awkward at start, Yaga I did not know what to say, it started to flow eventually, especially after we had finished eating. It was so nice to be with them both, I had not realised how much I had missed them. And was it nice to play tongo without having to explain game.

It was sad they had to go as early as they did, but it might be for best. I am sure good night rest will be helpful. Not to mention it meant I got back at same time as Nettle. Something makes me suspect Babcha visit to Arbiter did not go as planned.
