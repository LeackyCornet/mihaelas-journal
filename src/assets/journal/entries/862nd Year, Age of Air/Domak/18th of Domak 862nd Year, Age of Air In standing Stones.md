# 18th of Domak 862nd Year Age of Air, standing Stones

Pish, those things were heavy. How right was I? part of me wishes we'd left damn things behind. If only Vujek was here, he's strong and would have been able to carry some of stuff to make it easier for those less able, like us halflings. I still miss Vujek, we must find him. I hope we start looking for him soon.

It also would have helped if I still had my bag of holding. I wonder where it is, I'll have to ask Babcha.
