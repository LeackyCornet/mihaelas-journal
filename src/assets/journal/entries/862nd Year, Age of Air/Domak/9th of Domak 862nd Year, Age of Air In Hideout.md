# 9th of Domak 862 Age of Air, Hideout

Tower is finely finished, I can't help but feel that it would have been done sooner if she hadn't spent so much time telling orcs what to do while they've been preparing defences. I mean, Nettle is one who was in military. She's done fine directing them and has then just let them do it. I don't know why Babcha has to interfere. Anyway, it's done. And defences are coming along well also. I have feeling that we will be leaving here soon. I don't know if that makes me sad or happy. This place has begun to feel like home and I have enjoyed being able to go see people nearby. It almost feels like I'm making family again. I hadn't realised how much I'd missed it. However, there is lot to do and many things weigh on my mind. I want to find Vujek, we need to make sure King is safe, we want to help Morthos, and of course there is small matter of Empire. Dark times. I fear I must venture out of this small piece of comfort I have found.
