# 11th of Domak 862 Age of Air, Elderyard Road

Finally, we're on road again. Had very long talk this morning about how to get to standing stones in drilwood. Isophie used her magic to get us to Drilwood in end. Only trouble is it means Gertrude will be by himself for day until she gets back. I hope he copes.

We didn't stay long in Drilwood, only to get some supplies before making our way down Elderyard Road to stones, so I didn't have time to look for Eilnala.

It felt strange bring back in Drilwwod after so long, I can't say I miss it.
