# 20th of Obeli 862nd Year Age of Air, Temple of Shar

What couple of days I've had, Yaga. So much went wrong, I had such good idea. I was going to rid us of that dirty grokkel Karmi, traitor that he is, but it all went so wrong. Pemi, used wrong spell so he knew what I'd done, maybe I need to think more about this new magic stuff until I'm used to it bit more. But, worse than that, I swear he must have had some magic protection. So I got thrown in cells, was miserable in there, with that drunk and creep who kept licking his lips. I think it was nervous twitch, I hope it was, but he didn't have to keep staring at me. But, Yaga, worst of all was guard, miserable grokkel. All I wanted was my cards so I had something to do, but would he let me have them? No. and what good did it do him? All entertainment I had left to me was talking and even Nettle would have offered better conversation than those three. So I spoke to best conversationalist there was in damn place, myself. It was funny how much it annoyed guard, but if he'd only let me have my cards this would have been avoided. I even explained as much to him, not that he understood, don't think he understood halfling.

And all this after we'd spent so much time planning what we'd tell who in our attempt to find out who is crocked. Well, who in additions to Karmi. I hope I haven't messed that up. I'm also hoping it won't be necessary. Hopefully Remi will be true to her word and help us.

Can't believe I got out of that mess by myself. Ironic that using magic got me into mess and using magic got me out. I feel little bad about those guards, especially one who got pulled out of carriage. I hope he survived. I kinf of hope other one is ok, even if he was bit of dick. I told him what was going on after spell, but he didn't listen. But I guess I would do lot for my family, and I hope he's ok, if only for his family's sake. It was funny when I got away though, he couldn't figure that one out. Wasn't even my best get away. Yaga, wasn't even my best escape from this town. Which now I'm out of, finally, praise Llirra. And I thought Taromount was starting to feel like home. Wrong there, I guess.

I can't believe how awkward and unhelpful Nettle was. Ok, she's on wanted list, but she could have done something. I should be grateful to Mały, he was eager to help. Yaga, even Eary offered to help and she's calling me abomination. I don't understand Nettle, I wonder if I've done something to hurt her. Or if she at least perceives it as I have. Times like this I miss Vujek, he was always nice to me. I have Mały again, by LLirra I've missed him. Rascal wanted me to dress up in pem outfit Eary got.

I'm so glad he's here now. This place brings back uncomfortable memories, Babcha nearly died here. Still, at least she made it out city, I was so worried about her, going rambling round city just so she can get coin out bank, when it's being attacked by dragons. This whole thing seems to be going from worse to worse.

Praise be to LLirra we're out of that city. Hopefully we can actually do something now that'll actually have impact. Maybe it was good Vujek wasn't here. These last two days have been mess.

And all this, of course, is saying nothing of what actually happened when me and Mały went to get my things back with Eary. Guards at barracks went all by book until Eary touched one, I'm pretty sure she used magic, I'm starting to get feel for it. Worked treat to, one she touched immediately started doing as she said. Another one really didn't like it, but what did that matter. We were allowed through, to Quentis' office no less. Shame it was locked, but then Mały really pulled out stops. I don't think. No I. What am I doing?! Llirra, forgive me. Mały, if you read this, I'll keep my promise.

Pish.

Oh! I forgot, at least I now know what strange stone that man gave me in Thandrium is now. It's some magic item that lets people talk to each other. I saw Nettle use it to tell Babcha about traps we found in tunnel. I even found I could hear Babcha through mine.

Yaga, my mind is all over place. I suppose it's not surprising after this morning, it's good to get my thoughts down.

Speaking of my mind being all over place, I didn't actually finish writing about what happened in barracks. Silly me. After Mały did his thing we got into office and all my stuff was there. Now, I'm not particularly worried about material goods, they come and go and can be replaced. But I was glad to get my stuff back, people did go out their way to help me and I'll be much more use with that stuff. And my cloths are far more comfortable than those itchy dungeon trash to boot. We then returned to Final Toll where we learned of tunnels and made good our escape.

Don't care. If I've missed something, I've missed it. I'm actually going to finish this time and go to sleep.
