# 5th of Domak 862 Age of Air, Hideout

I'm starting to get hang of using this shield, but I still think Nettle is trying to kill me. my arm doesn't hurt as much after training though, I've learnt to parry with thing rather than just block. That's why my arm hurt so much first few sessions. But she's still breaking my guard at times and I'm covered in bruises. Hopefully it will be worth it.

But, Yaga, I feel for Morthos. I didn't know what had happened to Golblin Cleavers. Thinking about it, it is strange how two of them are here but not others. How did I not notice that. I know not why Gimble saw fit to lead them to standing stones in drillwood, but for his folly to cost Vadania her life is travesty of justice. Just wait until I get my hands on that pem gnome, grokkel, I'll make him squirm, he'll pay. As Llirra is my witness, he'll pay for robbing someone of so much joy, and all to satisfy their own petty ego. I never liked that Gnome, now I know I was justified.

I'm glad Babcha offered to help Morthos, he is pained soul, and while I know Babcha is kind at heart really, she can be little blunt. It would have been very easy of her to deal with that conversation without tact it needed. But, I am ready to help Morthos and so is Babcha. I'm sure we'll find Vadania and hopefully Morthos will find peace he needs, may Llirra find her way into his heart.

I'm not sure I should be saying this, it feels crass, but if we do go to drilwood hopefully I'll have opportunity to find Eilnala. I still think it's worth talking to Shadow Thieves and seeing if they'll help against Empire.

What have we got to lose? And Eilnala live in Drilwood, and works in drilwood. Hopefully I can find her.
