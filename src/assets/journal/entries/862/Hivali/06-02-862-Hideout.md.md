I've been crying all day. Ma≈Çy left this morning and saying goodbye was so painful, I pray I haven't lost him again. I'll never forgive myself. I've been praying for him all day. I'm so glad we've done this work on shine, it may not be finished but at least it gives me somewhere meaningful to pray.

Llirra, keep my brother safe. Let me see him again. I can' loose him again.
