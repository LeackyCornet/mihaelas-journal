# 5th of Hivali 862 Age of Air, Hideout

We spoke with Mały today and suggested he go scout Briar Pass and Waldern Heights. He agreed, Babcha seemed little worried he'd focus on powerful relics to much, as did Nettle, but I trust my Mały and I'm sure he'll do well. I just hope he stays safe, I'm sure he'll do good but Empire is powerful and scare me little. I don't know why Babcha doesn't trust him though. He's my brother and she's my Babcha, which makes her as good as family to me, which makes them family of sorts. How can you not trust your family? whatever, he's going and I'm sure he'll do well, maybe Babcha will trust him then.

He wanted to go straight away but I persuaded him to use day to prepare and leave on morrow, so we'd have one more night together. I'm glad I did and he stayed. This evening has been so much fun, we played tongo for so long. I tried to get Babcha to play but she wouldn't, but Durzol and Krusk joined us, as did Ailuin, I think she knows how much Mały means to me and values him, she knows he's part of this prophecy to.

I really don't want Mały to go, we've grown close again. Losing him once was hard enough, I don't want to do it again. At least this time I'll have good memories of him.
